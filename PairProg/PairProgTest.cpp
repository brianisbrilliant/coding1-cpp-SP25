    // #3 create a function that accepts two integers and returns their sum.
    // if that's too easy, overload it to also accept floats.

    // #2 same thing

    // #1 get the program to greet the two of you by name.
    // then run it.

    // #1 have the computer tell you two more things, on new lines.

    // #3 create a function that accepts a string and prints the string to the console with

    // #2 same thing

    // #1 create some variables, (ensure the other person has a chance to drive)
        // ask the user for input,
        // create a story.
